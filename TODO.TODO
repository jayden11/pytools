Sublime text package ideas:
  ☐ Unite TODOcontrol and plaintasks
    ☐ I would have search current projects for all TODO, NOTE, ect. and then compile a file like this where headings are file name (abs paths)
    ☐ When archiving I would add a tag that keeps track of which file each item came from (just name, not path)

Other:
  ☐ Clip to Evernote the sublime python API files.
